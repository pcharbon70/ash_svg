# Detailed Implementation Plan for AshSvg

This document provides a comprehensive, task-by-task breakdown of the implementation phases for the AshSvg animation system.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Each function/module must have corresponding unit tests
- Use ExUnit's property-based testing for mathematical functions
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Aim for 100% code coverage per section

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between modules within a section
- Verify data flow across system boundaries
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Ensure backwards compatibility as new sections are added

### Performance Testing
- Establish baseline benchmarks before optimization
- Use Benchee for consistent performance measurements
- Test with realistic data volumes (200+ elements)
- Monitor memory usage and garbage collection

### Test Organization

## Risk Mitigation

- **Performance Risk**: Implement benchmarks early, test with realistic loads
- **API Design Risk**: Create prototypes for user feedback before full implementation
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test on multiple browsers throughout development
- **Complexity Risk**: Keep API simple, hide complexity behind sensible defaults
- **Testing Risk**: Maintain test suite performance, use test parallelization
